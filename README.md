# Icons

At present the contents of this repository are drawings created by numerous contributors at an [IconLocal](https://openitp.org/design-tools/how-can-we-use-icons-to-communicate-about-security-and-privacy-an-iconlocal.html) design-a-thon at a conference. The current icons posted here relate to **security & privacy** and more information about the effort is described by @gusandrews in [this post about the event](http://gandre.ws/blog/blog/2015/03/25/ctf-iconlocal-rough-sketches/)

*The loose idea of this repo is to apply aspects of open source software development (sharing, iteration, forking, extending, and modifying) to the icon design process.*

## Getting Started

The following is a work in progress and totally open to suggestions and modifications to icons as well as the  process itself!

1. Fork this respository
2. Clone your fork to your computer
3. Work on an icon from the "To-Do" list below
	- Trace a hand drawing to make a vector
	- Duplicate an existing icon
	- Mix & match pieces of existing icons
4. Save your work with a git commit
5. Submit a pull request back to this project
6. Have a tasty beverage & celebrate being an open source designer :wink:

### Next Steps

Once we get through making most of these icons, we can assess how well this process went and then consider applying it to other icons.

Also, at some point we can just add en-masse a bunch of open source icons. However, must be careful not to replicate [The Noun Project](http://thenounproject.com) as they've done such a great job!
